CERTIFICATE STORE FUNCTIONS
    A user site can, over time, collect many certificates. Typically, a site
    has certificates for the user of the site, and other certificates
    describing those individuals and entities with whom the user
    communicates. For each entity, there can be more than one certificate.
    For each individual certificate, there should be a chain of verifying
    certificates that provides a trail back to a trusted root certificate.
    Certificate stores and their related functions provide functionality to
    store, retrieve, enumerate, verify, and use the information stored in
    the certificates.

    The following functions are used to work with the certificate stores,
    themselves.

  CertAddStoreToCollection
  CertCloseStore
  CertControlStore
  CertDuplicateStore
  CertEnumPhysicalStore
  CertEnumSystemStore
